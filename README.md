# Speed_Typing_Test
The provided Python code is a simple typing speed test program. It begins by defining a list of sentences. Then, it randomly selects one of the sentences and presents it to the user for typing. The user is prompted to press Enter to start the typing test.
Once the user starts typing the displayed sentence, the program records the start time and end time to calculate the time taken to complete the typing task. It also calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of words typed and the time taken.
Additionally, the program calculates the accuracy of the user's typing by comparing the input with the original sentence. It counts the number of correctly typed words and calculates the accuracy as a percentage.
Finally, the program prints out the typing speed (WPM), accuracy percentage, and the time taken in seconds.
